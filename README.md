## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd expense_tracking
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure you have access to an Oracle database
   - Update database connection details in `backend/db_helper.py`
   - Create the required `expenses` table with the following schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE expenses (
       id NUMBER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY
       expense_date DATE,
       amount NUMBER,
       category VARCHAR2(100),
       notes VARCHAR2(500)
   );
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8088
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8088`

### Starting the Frontend Application

```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

The web application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## API Endpoints
